# Summary

There does not appear to be any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Both seem to be pretty evenly split in regards to total reviews and five_star reviews. Another analysis worth looking into would be the % of votes for each star rating. Doing this analysis with those stats in place would be beneficial.
